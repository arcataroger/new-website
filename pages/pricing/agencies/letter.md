Hey, ðŸ‘‹

we don't know each other personally â€” _yet!_ â€” but having run web agencies for +10 years before starting DatoCMS... we feel like we kinda know you, at least a bit.

- We know (painfully well) how hard your work is. Keep fighting!
- We know how many projects you're simultaneously working on right now (that's too simple, _far too many_).
- We know how much they're different in size and scope, no matter how much you might try to standardize things.
- We know how difficult is to find the time for anything except keeping your clients happy.

### What you need from a CMS

We also know a thing or two about what you need from your CMS:

- **You need something you can fully trust**. I mean, 100% trust. Something that you know it will NEVER add another layer of complexity to your already frantic everyday-work.
- **You need something flexible**, that can adapt to any current (and future) scenario. Big projects, small projects, micro projects, huge projects. If it cannot fit EVERY case, it means you need to learn and train your people to work on multiple CMSs, which is simply stupid.
- **You need something that will last over time**, or in two years from now, when one of your past clients will come out of the blue to ask for some new sections, you'll be in big trouble.
- **You need something cheap**, because the least thing you want is having to convince your final client about another cost â€” moreover, one you don't get anything out of!

### We want a long-lasting relationship with you

We'll be frank here. Agencies are our best customers, period.

They produce a huge number of quality sites each year, they act as ambassadors of our product, and once they learn to use it, the required support is reduced to a minimum. Heck, agencies are even the ones who most frequently contribute to our ecosystem of plugins and project starters. What more can you ask?!

**That's why we're dramatically lowering the price for you.**

We're not interested in milking you. We are (more than) happy to offer you an absolutely no-brainer price if you start adopting DatoCMS as your default CMS in your agency.

We're looking for a long-lasting, ongoing relationship with you, and we're happy to come towards you.

If you normally work on many small projects that require very few resources... **why not giving you the chance to use us for as low as ie. 10 EUR/month?** Somewhere along the line, maybe you'll have larger projects on you're plate, and you will be happy to buy a larger plan for that specific project. Win-win for everyone!

### Let's have a 15 minute call!

We're 100% positive that any pre-cooked plan/formula we can offer in this page you will not be able to fully satisfy you. You're too special, like every other agency.

**We need to know each other.** Let's have a 15 minute call. Tell us your needs, how you work, what you're looking for. We'll be happy put you in touch with other partners, so that you can listen their experience with DatoCMS.

At the end of the call, we'll make you a custom pricing solution 100% tailored to your needs, that scales with the number of projects, and we'll always be ready to reshape it in the future if your needs change.
