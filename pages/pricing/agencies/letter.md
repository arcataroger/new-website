Hey, ðŸ‘‹

we don't know each other personally â€” _yet!_ â€” but having run web agencies for +10 years before starting DatoCMS... we feel like we kinda know you, at least a bit.

For example, we know painfully well how difficult is to find the time for anything else than keeping your clients happy. So thanks for taking the time to read these lines (and keep fighting)!

We also know how many projects you're simultaneously working on right now (that's simple, _far too many_), and how much they're different in size and scope, no matter how much you might try to standardize things...

### What you need from a CMS

We can easily guess what your expectations might be for a CMS. It was such a critical part of our work as an agency, that we built DatoCMS around them:

- **You need something you can fully trust**. I mean, 100% trust. Something that you know it will NEVER add another layer of complexity to your already frantic everyday-work.
- **You need something flexible**, that can adapt to any current (and future) scenario. Big projects, small projects, micro projects, huge projects. If it cannot fit EVERY case, it means you need to learn and train your people to work on multiple CMSs, which is simply stupid.
- **You need something that will last over time**, or in two years from now, when one of your past clients will come out of the blue asking for some new section, you'll be in big trouble.
- **You need something cheap**, because the least thing you want is having to convince your final client about another cost â€” moreover, one you don't get anything out of!

### We want a long-lasting relationship with you

We'll be frank here. Agencies are our best customers, period.

They produce a huge number of quality sites each year, they act as ambassadors of our product, and once they learn to use it, the required support is reduced to a minimum. Heck, agencies are even the ones who most frequently contribute to our ecosystem of plugins and project starters. What more can you ask?!

**That's why we're dramatically lowering the price for you.**

We're not interested in milking you. We're looking for a long-lasting, ongoing relationship, and we're more than happy to come towards you in any way we can. Our goal here is to offer you an absolutely no-brainer price so that you can start adopting DatoCMS as your default CMS, starting from the very next work in your pipeline.

If you normally work on many small projects that require very few resources... **why should we not give you the chance to use us for as low as ie. 10 EUR/month per project?**

We might not become rich from those tiny projects, but maybe somewhere along the line you'll have larger projects on you're plate, and if you liked DatoCMS you'll be happy to suggest a larger plan for that specific project and client. Win-win for everyone!

### Let's have a 15 minute call!

We're 100% positive that any pre-cooked plan/formula we can offer in this page you will not be able to fully satisfy you. You're too special, like every other agency.

**We need to know each other.** Let's have a 15 minute call.

Tell us your needs, how you work, what you're looking for. Togheter, we'll build a super-convenient, custom-tailored price around your specific needs, capable of scaling with the number of projects, with no up-front investment for you.

Ask us to put you in touch with some other Agency Partners, listen to their experience with us. Ask us to book some time with our core engineers, to clear your doubts and help you get the most out of DatoCMS.

Challenge us. We're here for the long run, and we can't wait to meet you! âœŠ
